                <h4>Live a life of service</h4>
                <p>Everything we do in life can translate to service in one purpose or another. For example a trip to the store to pick up a few items
                can also be serving a smile to the clerk during checkout, giving thanks for their service so they feel appreciated, or simply giving
                thanks that you were able to walk, ride or drive to the store, perhaps on your own or without the assistance of someone else. Turn your
                need or necessity into something that gives back - in any way and watch how The Universe shifts that positive energy into your direction.</p>

                <p>Live fearlessly. And this is important because so often we can get hung up on what society thinks of us and the truth is we all have our
                quirks, the things that make us uniquely us and as long as we're not hurting anyone it's okay to express who you are. In order to do that you
                have to be fearless in your pursuit of everything that lights your soul up, everything that makes up YOU.</p>
            </div>

            <div class="advice-half">
                <h4>Success equals</h4>
                <p>Take all of your wildest dreams, mix in all of your fear and then bake that cake. Do it. Because that's what success is. It's taking
                everything you dream of, everything you KNOW you can be and using that fear to push you from behind to achieve those dreams.</p>

                <p>It's life and the fear is just uncertainty of what will happen after you've started pursuing those dreams. Fear not because that
                hasn't even happened yet, let your future self be concerned with that once you get there.</p>

                <p>I used to believe I could do everything. Then I grew up and realized I can do anything but not everything, at least not all at
                once. As my son tells me all the time it's about giving yourself credit for what you know how to do and learning how to do the rest.
